### What I learned

During the period of coding out the sunnyside agency landing page, I observed how scaling works when using percentages for measurement, it might be really frustrating starting out with the % unit of measurement instead of px, rem and vh/vw.
Of all attention to details played a crucial part of the design I coded.


### Continued development

Scroll-snapping is an interesting style effect that snaps a specified page layout to either stick at the top, center or at the end of your browser screen.
This was only done for chrome browser, will be working on adding this effect to the IE and Firefox in the future


### Useful resources
